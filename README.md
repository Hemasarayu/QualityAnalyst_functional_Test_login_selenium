"Quality Assurance  Testing using Selenium"
 Objective:
To perform functional and automation testing for the login functionality of the SauceDemo website using Selenium WebDriver.


 Tasks Performed:

 
•Designed and executed manual test cases for login functionality (valid & invalid scenarios)

•Performed functional testing on the SauceDemo login page

•Developed a Selenium automation script to validate one login scenario

•Created a Defect Report documenting issues found during testing

•Used assertions to verify expected outcomes

•Organized all deliverables and presented findings clearly


Project Deliverables:


•File 

•Description

•login_test_cases.xlsx

•Manual test cases for SauceDemo login scenarios

•defect_report.xlsx

•Document listing all identified defects

•login_automation_script.java

•Selenium automation script for login test case




README.md Project overview and documentation  Manual Test Scenarios Covered:


✅ Valid username and password — login successful, redirected to inventory page

❌ Valid username, invalid password — incorrect password message displayed

⚠️ Both fields blank — should display both field validation messages

❌ Invalid username, valid password — invalid credentials message displayed

🔁 Valid login followed by logout — user redirected back to login page



 Defects Found on Testing:

 
  •Mentioned in defect entries file.


 Tools Used:

 
•Website: https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/

•Selenium WebDriver (Java)

•JUnit/TestNG for assertions

•Google Chrome for browser testing

•Excel for documenting test cases and defects.



 How to Run the Automation Script:
 
•Clone this repository

•Open the project in  IntelliJ / VS Code/py charm

•Ensure Selenium libraries are configured in your build path

•Update WebDriver path in the script if necessary

•Run the script as a TestNG or JUnit test

•Check the console for assertion results and status messages



 Key Learnings:
 
 
•Designed structured test cases and applied them on a real website.

•Gained hands-on experience with functional testing and Selenium automation

•Practiced defect reporting and issue documentation.

•Strengthened understanding of test validations, assertions, and error message handling.
