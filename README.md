"Quality Assurance  Testing using Selenium"
📘 Objective
To perform functional and automation testing for the login functionality of the SauceDemo website using Selenium WebDriver.
🎯 Tasks Performed
Designed and executed manual test cases for login functionality (valid & invalid scenarios).
Performed functional testing on the SauceDemo login page.
Developed a Selenium automation script to validate one login scenario.
Created a Defect Report documenting issues found during testing.
Used assertions to verify expected outcomes.
Organized all deliverables and presented findings clearly.
